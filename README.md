# Combine_Synonyms

# Question

Alice is learning a new language Y(not programming language). She seeks help from her friend
Bob who is an expert in that language. She started reading books which were written in language
Y and when ever she encounters a word whose meaning she is not familiar with, she asks the
synonym of the word from Bob and Bob responds with synonyms of the words. Alice notes down
them in her notes. As this process goes , Alice noted down large list of synonyms in her notes.
As she is going through the notes , she made a glaring observation that she can combine some
of the synonyms. Let suppose if word1 word2 word3 are synonyms and word2 word5 are
synonyms then she can combine them into a single list word1 word2 word3 word5


# Example

syn_list = [[’oranges’,’dogs’, ’apples’],[’peach’, ’mango’],[’dogs’, ’cats’]]

output = [[’oranges’,’dogs’, ’apples’,’cats’],[’peach’,’mango’]]
